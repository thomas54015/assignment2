(b) 9, git log

(c) Wed Sep 25 18:13:30 2019, git log .gitignore

(d) 1. So that one can work on bugs without changing the master branch.
    2. So that people can build new features before launching them.

(e) git status shows you the current status of whats going on.
    git log shows you past pushes and commits.

(f) git log Vehicle.h

(g) git log --grep="file"

(h) I. Where there are parent classes and the child classes inherits from them
    II. To have pointer of derived be able to point to base class. You can make
    pointers of parent classes point to children objects.
    III. To contain data in a single unit.

(i) "Integration manager", each developer gets a public repository.
    "Dictator and Lieutenants", works more like a pyramid where developers send
    their code to lieutenants to work them out then send it to dictator who pushes
    correctly to the main repository.

(j) "Dictator and Lieutenants" would keep it more organized instead of everyone
    pushing and taking too much control. Dictator and Lieutenants would help
    make sure the code works better together and allows only limited control to
    people who may not know as much.
